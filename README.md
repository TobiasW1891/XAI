# XAI

This repository includes some instructive jupyter-notebooks which deal with some methods from explainable AI (XAI). I code the methods myself (or at least something that reflects the method's core ideas) and then use the "official" packages of the methods. So far, LIME and SHAP have been remodelled for numerical data.
